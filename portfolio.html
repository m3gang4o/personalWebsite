        This project was created on code.org during my AP Computer Science Principles course. The project would provide a random image of a letter in ASL and the user would have to guess the answer. If the user's guess was correct, the output would be "Correct!. If the user's guess was wrong, the output would be "Try Again!".

    <p> I made this project during my SPP at GWC! Based on your answers to the three questions, it will output a Kdrama you should watch! </p>

    <p>I made this project during my SPP at GWC! I decided to create a website about Asian-American violence. It includes a homepage explaining the issue. Then, there is an "Explore Resources" page where users can find different resources to understand the cause. Lastly, there is a "Take Action!" page where users can enter code and recieve a scripted message they can use to report their personal incident!</p>

    <p>I made this website during a hackathon. It follows a similar format to my previous activist toolkit project. The goal of the project was to define the problem and create a solution about algorithmic justice throughout current day media. It includes a homepage explaining and defining the topic. Then, it contains a "Common Questions" page where it explores and answers different questions about algorithmic justice. Lastly, there is "Take Action!" page where users can enter code and receive a scripted message to report their abuse and different concerns they have faced.</p>
